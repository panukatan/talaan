The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) makes civil registration data
publicly available through their monthly updates on numbers of births,
deaths, and marriages released via their website. This package provides
utilities for accessing and processing the civil registration and vital
statistics data released by the PSA.

## What does `talaan` do?

Please note that `talaan` is still highly experimental and is undergoing
a lot of development. Hence, any functionalities described below and in
the rest of the package documentation have a high likelihood of changing
interface or approach as we aim for a stable working version.

Currently, the package provides the following functionalities:

### Monthly update releases

- Retrieval and/or download of monthly civil registry and vital
  statistics updates released by the PSA on their website;

- Standardised naming of civil registry and vital statistics release
  files;

- Upload and/or archive raw monthly civil registry and vital statistics
  releases onto specific platforms; and,

- Process monthly civil registry and vital statistics releases into
  machine-readable and relational database-ready structures.

### Historical/archived datasets

- Retrieval and/or download of historical/archived civil registry and
  vital statistics datasets made available on the PSA website;

- Standardised naming of civil registry and vital statistics
  historical/archived files;

- Upload and/or archive raw historical civil registry and vital
  statistics datasets onto specific platforms; and,

- Process historical/archived civil registry and vital statistics
  datasets into machine-readable and relational database-ready
  structures.
